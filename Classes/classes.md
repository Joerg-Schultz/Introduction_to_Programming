## Classes

### Theory

This is such an important and large topic, that I stay back and let others explain. Start by watching this [video](https://youtu.be/a4-AeT0cVEc?list=PLQkwcJG4YTCRSQikwhtoApYs9ij_Hc5Z9&t=48) and after that read the following three atoms: (i) [atom classes](https://stepik.org/lesson/104328/step/1?unit=78888), (ii) [atom properties](https://stepik.org/lesson/104329/step/1?unit=78889) and (iii) [atom Constructors](https://stepik.org/lesson/104330/step/1?unit=78890)

### Actions

Solve Exercises for Introduction to Objects, Creating Classes

Solve Exercises for Properties. In exercise 1, don't worry about the main() function, the important thing is to get `class X` right. 

Solve Exercises for Constructors
