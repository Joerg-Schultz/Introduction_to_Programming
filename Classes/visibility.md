## Visibility

### Theory

Now you've created classed and even inherited from them, you might have generated properties, which are only interesting for the class itself. Even more, you might not want other that others even see these features. And this is where visibility modifiers come into the game. They enable you to make a variable or a function `private`, i.e. visible only within a specific class. Using this approach, you can encapsulate all details of a class in itself. Very handy, when your code contains multiple classes.

As always, here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQwrHyv96pk&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCRSQikwhtoApYs9ij_Hc5Z9&index=22) explaining more of the details.
