## Nullability

### Theory

OK, so we learned about variables. But what happens, when a variable doesn't have a value? I mean, not only an empty string or 0 but nothing? In Kotlin (and other languages), this 'nothing' is called `null`. Having a variable with the value `null`can lead to tons of trouble in your code. Just imagine you want to print such a variable - sounds harmless, but will crash your program. Luckily, Kotlin checks already at compile time whether you (or your code) might run into such a problem and provides some useful operators to cope with this problem. That's why it is said that Kotlin provides [Null-Safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/null-safety.html).
