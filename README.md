## An introductory course to programming (not only) for Biologists

In this course we will use the language [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) to start programming. At the end of the course you will have coded your own Android App. You can find the source code of my version of the App in the [DiceApp](https://github.com/Joerg-Schultz/DiceApp) repository.
