## Testing

### Theory

Wouldn't it be cool, if we could assure that our app is still doing what it should at every moment we write a new piece of code? And doing this completely automatically? This is where automated testing comes into the game. You tell Kotlin what you expect how your function, class, viewmodel, button... should behave. And then Kotlin checks this automatically for your on the click of a button. This also gives you the good feeling that your new features don't break any old code and allow you to develop boldly.

Following, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rew86GST0g0&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCSYJ13G4kVIJ10X5zisB2Lq&index=2) to learn how to write good tests. And finally, let's dig in and write your [first tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0ag98EDhGc&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCSYJ13G4kVIJ10X5zisB2Lq&index=3).

### Actions

Write unit tests for all features of our dice class. And yes, this is the wrong way round. When you start writing your own app, you will always first write the test and only then write the code. Test Driven Development makes your life easier!
