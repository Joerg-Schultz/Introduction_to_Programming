## Git and GitHub

### Theory

Did you ever use file names like `protocol_final.docx`, `protocol_really_final.docx`, `protocol_final_gold.docx` and the like? Then this section is for you! Learn how to use a real versioning system and be able to keep track of different versions without relying on filenames, be able to switch between different versions, and even work together with other students without sending files via mail.

So, here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqo08bQXU4Q&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCQTEk4J4btiOJBV0PhKjJVS&index=1) giving some rationale on why versioning in general and Git / GitHub (the versioning system we'll use) are cool.

### Actions

1. make a repository for your current project. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7fyiIh-GX4&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCQTEk4J4btiOJBV0PhKjJVS&index=2) explains how to do this. Don't worry about Philipp using Android Studio, it works just the same in Intellij IDEA. And it is awesome that he explains how to use Git on the command line. Still, don't get overwhelmed, he also shows how to do this with a few clicks in the IDE.
2. Now you have a repository, push it to GitHub! You have to create a GitHub account, in case you don't have one yet. The follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4arVMGJ0_Ww&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCQTEk4J4btiOJBV0PhKjJVS&index=6) and see how your code is no accessible via GitHub!
