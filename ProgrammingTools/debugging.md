## Debugging

### Theory

A debugger can help you a lot when your programming is compiling (it is syntactically correct) but not doing what you want it to do. With a debugger you can step through your program and inspect the value of variables and any step (among other cool things).Nicely, the IntelliJ IDE has a debugger integrated. You can check a less than 10 min summary in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAWnIP1S6UA).

### Actions

Actually, there are no real actions here :) Just start to use the debugger whenever your program is not behaving as you thought it should.
