## Hello World
Requires: [Setup](../Setup/.setup.html)

### Theory
The 'Hello World' program does nothing more than wirite exactly this string. 
Still, it is so iconic that there is even a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) for it!
So, to start our journey into coding, let's write this program in Kotlin. Let's start with the Atomic Kotlin chapter - aptly named
[Hello, World](https://stepik.org/lesson/103796/step/1). You can run the code directly on the page, so play around a bit and check
whether you can print "Kotlin @ CCTB"!

### Action
Now let's go to our IDE and open the Atomic Kotlin course. In the 'Programming Basics' -> Hello, World solve the Exercises 1-5. In case you run into problems (like how to comment out a line in exercise 3, check the 'Hello World!' chapter of [Atomic Kotlin](https://leanpub.com/AtomicKotlin/read_sample))
