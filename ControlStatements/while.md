## while

### Theory
Now that you've learned how to conditionally run parts of your code, let's talk about how you can run the same part of your code multiple times. As a first variant, we will use the `while` loop which, as the name suggests, executes a code block as long as a condition is true. (Note: A code block is everything enclosed in `{ }`).

You can read more about the while loop in [this atom](https://stepik.org/lesson/103808/step/1?unit=78380) and in the [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/control-flow.html#while-loops). 

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSHjROeqT38&list=PLlxmoA0rQ-LwgK1JsnMsakYNACYGa1cjR&index=23) shows you in detail, how the while loop runs and when the condition is checked.

### Actions

Solve Exercises 2, 3, 4. In exercise 3, you can either use the modulo operator or modify the increment.
