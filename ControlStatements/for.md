## for and ranges

### Theory
Where's the while Loop can be used to execute a part of code until a condition becomes false, the for loop helps you to execute code for a number of times. 
Here, we also introduce the `..` operator. In Kotlin speak, this is the range operator, which generates all numbers (or characters) in a range (hence the name ;-). So, if you write `1..10` you will generate all integer numbers from 1 to 10 (including 1 and 10). [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNRbbMKOd-E&list=PLlxmoA0rQ-LwgK1JsnMsakYNACYGa1cjR&index=17) will show you some more useful things you can do with ranges. 

Now that we understood how we can generate a range of numbers, we can use this to execute a code block for a number of times - given by a range! [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugz2W_yF208&list=PLlxmoA0rQ-LwgK1JsnMsakYNACYGa1cjR&index=21) you can see how you code this using a for loop and how exactly Kotlin decides whether it should run the code again or should finish.

### Actions

Solve 'Looping & ranges' exercises. In exercise 4, you are asked to use the `repeat()` function. There are actually two functions with this name in Kotlin, one working as a [flow control statement](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/repeat.html), the other as [method for character sequences](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.text/repeat.html). Both can be used here, just play around :-)
