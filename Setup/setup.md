# Setup
## Integrated Development Environment
### Theory

In out course we will use an integrated Development Environment which makes coding, executing code and debugging considerably easier. Fpr plain Android development, an excellent free IDE is [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Here, we will use [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) instead, as we will use its education plugin (see next section). For us, the free Community edition is more than sufficient. Still as a student (or teacher ;-), you can get the Ultimate version for free with an [academic licence](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). 

### Action
Watch [Installation of Intellij IDEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnoVsB7uIcE&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCRSQikwhtoApYs9ij_Hc5Z9&index=2) to 5:33 (at least) and install IDEA.
