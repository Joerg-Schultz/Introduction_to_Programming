## Sets

### Theory
Sets are pretty similar to lists. The main difference is, that they can hold an object only once, i.e. all the contents are unique.

Check the [atom](https://stepik.org/lesson/104337/step/1?unit=78897) and view this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJkCDXhLtDI&list=PLlxmoA0rQ-LwgK1JsnMsakYNACYGa1cjR&index=57)

### Actions

Solve the Exercises for Sets.

Note the generation of random numbers in Exercise 2! We will need this for our Dice-App. In  Exercise 3, the [intersect](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/intersect.html) operator comes in handy ;-) And [here](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-set/) is a list of functions for Sets. You might find another one helpful in the calculation of the 'percentOther'
