## Maps

### Theory

Maps allow you to connect two values as a key-value pair. As biologists, we use this all the time. As an example think of a species which has a name and a gene count. Or a gene which gain has a name and a sequence. Without Maps, we would keep this information in two independent but synchronized lists. Ugly. But in Kotlin, there are Maps and MutableMaps to the rescue!

Read the corresponding [atom](https://stepik.org/lesson/104338/step/1?unit=78898).
Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73RTzuFWqm4&list=PLlxmoA0rQ-LwgK1JsnMsakYNACYGa1cjR&index=56). The cool thing about Maps is, that you can use anything as the key, not only Ints as shown here. So, the key could be species name and the value the number of genes, for example.

### Action

We'll come back to this once we learned about classes, which are used in the Examples.
