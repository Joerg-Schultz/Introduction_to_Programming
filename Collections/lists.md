## Lists

### Theory

Lists are, as the name already says, collections ordered collections of things. As with variables, they come in two types: (i) Mutables lists, which can be changed after creation and (ii) immutable lists, which are fixed after creation. You might compare this with the [val and var](../VariablesAndDataTypes/variables.md) annotation when creating a new variable.

As always, read your [Atom](https://stepik.org/lesson/104335/step/1?unit=78895)

Here's a pretty extensive [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDWy16UDeLQ) about what you can do with lists in Kotlin. Don't get overwhelmed, just put a note somewhere into your brain that, before programming some list functionality, check whether Kotlin not already provides it!

### Actions

Solve the exercises in the list section (it's in the 'Introduction to objects' chapter).
