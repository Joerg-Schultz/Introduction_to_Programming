## Inheritance

### Theory

In this section, we will implement a Coin class. If you think about it, a Coin is just a Die with two sides. So, instead of copying the code from our Dice class into a new Coin class, we will use inheritance. As a side-note, copying the same code into different places of your project is always ugly. Sooner than later, you will change the code in one place, forget to change it in the other and you waste tons of time to debug this. As you will see, after some changes in the Dice class, the Coin class is more or less just resetting a single property.

### Action

And again, follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wZDMaQA_s4) to implement the Coin class in your App.
