## Navigation

### Theory

So far, our display consists only of a single fragment. But already now we have more information on the screen than we might want to present. Typically, a user might primarily be interested in the current random value. Only rarely, she might want to see the history of all values generated thus far. Thus, it would be usefull to separate these two pieces of information onto two different views. The App starts with the 'generate a new random value' view and on a click of a button it shows a 'history' view. In this section, we will implement exactly this behaviour.

We will use the [Navigation components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to accomplish this. And here's [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI0NIk-7cz8&list=PLSrm9z4zp4mHilvsfUM3jeCYFV3fTAS3J) which shows how to actually implement it.


### Actions
