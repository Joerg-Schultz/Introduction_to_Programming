## Classes

### Theory

Now you've learned about classes, let's apply this for our App! At the moment, we are generating the new random value within the fragment. This is not very nice, as we are mixing up the logic of the app (how exactly is the number generated) with the user interface (how do we present the value to the user). Thus, if we want to change the logic, we have to dive into the code of the User Interface. It would be better, if we could separate these two layers. And with the new knowledge about classes, that's pretty straightforward! 

### Actions

So, let's dive into the code and follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIGNOvTLSrA) to implement a Die (Dice) class and move its function from the fragment.
