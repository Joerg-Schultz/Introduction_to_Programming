## Dice App Skeleton

### Theory
Here, we will start the Dice App project. Therefore, you will generate a new Android project in IntelliJ. As you will see, the IDE already offers you different types of pre-made skeletons. In our project, we will go for the 'Modelview and Fragment' variant. In the latter stages of the project you will learn what this exactly means. If you are curious, it is an implementation of the [Model View ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) (MVVM) way of organising your code.
