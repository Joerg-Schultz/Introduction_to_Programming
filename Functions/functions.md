## Functions

### Theory

Frequently, you have a piece of code you want to execute in different parts of your program. You can do this by grouping the code together and give it a name. Then, you can execute this code by just calling the name wherever you want. You made a function out of this piece of code!

You can read a bit more like how to get information into your function and how to retrieve some results out of it [here](https://stepik.org/lesson/104306/step/1?unit=78864).

### Action

Solve the exercises 1-4 in the Function section.
